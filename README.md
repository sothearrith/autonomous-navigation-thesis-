Implementing TD3 for Continuous Control in Autonomous Mobile Robot Navigation
This project demonstrates autonomous navigation for a mobile robot inside a simulated warehouse environment using Isaac Sim. Powered by the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm and guided by real-time LiDAR data, the robot learns to reach goals while avoiding obstacles.
